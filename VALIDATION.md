# Design review: 1k resistors and readable Python — 2026-10-19

The original build is preserved on `design_review_1` at
`28e3c1114d4984cd8f6888d6509e786220378dfc`. All earlier entries below describe
that 2k-resistor design. Current `main` uses the 1k models and doubled lengths;
see the [change and code-review guide](docs/DESIGN_REVIEW.md).

Checks completed using the installed `hpretl/iic-osic-tools` image
`5d6adf1f437c`, GF180MCU-D, ngspice 46 and Xschem 3.4.8RC:

- **37 runner tests pass**, including nominal resistance preservation for all
  16 instances, fingerprint sensitivity and rejection of stale result caches.
- **3 plotting tests pass**.
- **40 Xschem netlists pass** across fresh, moved and configured checkouts. The
  closed loop-probe still matches all 86 statements in the untrimmed core.
- Comparison with the preserved branch confirms that the three schematics
  differ only in resistor symbols/models and lengths. Syntax-tree comparison
  confirms equivalent computations in 57 runner helpers after renaming and
  docstring changes; the four reformatted companion scripts are also equivalent.
- All ten testbenches complete their selected **smoke profiles**: 16 case
  bundles, no execution failures and no simulator warnings reported by the
  runner. TB01–TB09 use `smoke`; TB10 uses `trim_nominal`, with all 128 codes
  at each of 3.3 V and 5 V, followed by selected-code cold start and restart.
  No PDK model or measurement threshold was modified for these runs.

The [saved smoke reports](docs/results/design-review-2026-10-19/README.md)
include source hashes and actual measurements. These are execution checks,
not full electrical qualification: nominal untrimmed PSRR reaches only
**52.03 dB minimum** against the existing 60 dB target, untrimmed temperature
coefficient is **11.22 ppm/°C** against 10 ppm/°C, and TB08 reports one device
voltage-screen flag. Only one of three TB06 draws meets its original voltage
band. TB10 selects **code 72**, gives **1.194230 V at 3.3 V**, and passes its
nominal startup/restart checks at both supplies. This voltage-target calibration
does not replace a temperature-minimizing trim study.

Full PVT, minimum-drift trim calibration, mismatch, layout dimensions/parasitics
and extracted performance still need revalidation for the 1k option. The old
specification estimates and temperature-trim codes must not be treated as
measurements of this revision. New runs should use a fresh results root;
automatic migration of predecessor caches has been removed.

# Temperature-first trim calibration — 2026-09-28

The revised project goal is approximately **1.18 V**, with the physical resistor
trim selected for minimum temperature drift. The [published result package](docs/results/trim-temperature-2026-09-28/README.md)
contains the charts, all 14,940 selected temperature points, 45 trim-code records,
summary, provenance, and a chart generator.

- The saved 128-code DC screen covers 5 MOS × 3 BJT × 3 resistor corners,
  typical MIM, −40/25/125 °C, 3.3/5 V AVDD, and 3.3 V DVDD.
- Dense follow-up checks evaluated the selected code and its two neighbors
  at 1 °C steps from −40 to 125 °C. All 135 jobs completed (44,820 DC points).
- One code is held across both supplies and all temperatures per process
  combination. All 14,940 selected points pass the existing self-sustaining
  current checks.
- Worst-of-supplies box TC: **2.54 ppm/°C typical**, **2.99 ppm/°C median**,
  **5.28 ppm/°C worst**. Output spans **1.173776-1.189448 V**; maximum analog
  current is **54.42 µA**. These support provisional goals of 1.18 V ±1%,
  ≤10 ppm/°C, and ≤60 µA within this screen.
- Code selection compares all 128 sampled candidates and uses a conservative
  sampled-span lower bound to exclude the remaining dense candidates. Selected
  dense sweeps agree with saved independent operating points within 0.356 µV.
- These results do not include mismatch, intermediate/stress supplies,
  startup/restart, trimmed-core AC/noise/stability, or extracted layout. They
  do not resolve earlier transient simulator aborts.

The source circuit and standard runner settings remain unchanged. Its 1.194 V
voltage-calibration mode is distinct from this temperature-first analysis.
Earlier records below retain their original scope and results.

# Corrected plots and preserved targeted reruns - 2026-09-28

This update does not change any schematic, model, simulation tolerance, or
measurement algorithm. It adds a separate-output root and exact case selection,
plus a source-snapshot preparation tool for reproducible focused reruns.

- All 34 standard-library software checks pass. The new checks reject invalid
  selections, verify output isolation and partial-coverage markers, and prove
  preparation preserves source reports and refuses an existing destination.
- All 3 plotting checks pass, including actual maximum overshoot selection and
  bounded plot sizes/labels for a synthetic 1,600-case loop sweep.
- The saved full TB01-TB09 reports regenerated 44 figures without errors. All
  pages were visually reviewed. Maxima now use max, VREF uses corner envelopes,
  TB08 separates nominal and stress supplies, and TB05 uses readable distributions
  and limited curves that retain sampled margin extremes.
- No electrical simulations were launched for this update. The existing TB05
  report remains historical and does not qualify the repaired probe core.
- The prepared rerun snapshot produced valid fresh netlists for TB03, TB05,
  TB09 and TB10. Closing the probe cuts matched all 86 untrimmed-core statements.
  Planning selected 65, 2,835, 458 and 405 cases/bundles respectively, all under
  the new output root. Baseline report/PDF and schematic hashes were unchanged.

The focused September 27-28 reproducer sets contain 65 TB03 and 458 TB09 cases:
all execution failures plus nominal readiness misses with valid references.
Offset-only misses are excluded, not resolved. Full regression remains necessary
after circuit changes. Old reports and caches are preserved only by using a
separate output folder; --retry-failed alone is not archival protection.

# TB10 full-profile coverage - 2026-09-28

The old full-suite command explicitly forced TB10 to `trim_nominal`, and the
runner rejected other trim PVT axes. TB10 now supports the configured `full`
and `smoke` grids; the JSON default and suite instructions select `full`.
The existing `trim_nominal` quick check remains available.

The full schedule contains 405 process/temperature bundles: 135 process
combinations, three temperatures, and seven analog supplies per bundle.
It plans 362,880 code-sweep DC points, 51,840 calibration DC points and
2,835 cold-start/restart transients. A separate 25 C / 3.3 V calibration
holds the code fixed across all V/T points for each deterministic process
corner. Temperature bundles repeat identical calibration decks so they
can resume independently. Nominal and stress results are reported separately.

Validation used the installed GF180MCUD models and ngspice 46:

- All 31 software checks pass, including full-grid counts, incomplete tables,
  code retention across temperature, and partial-failure accounting.
- A freshly netlisted TB10 ran the first three real full-profile bundles:
  typical process at -40, 25 and 125 C, all seven supplies. The report explicitly
  remains incomplete: 3 of 405 planned bundles. Repeating the same command
  reused the three cached outcomes without turning failures into passes.
- All 2,688 sweep DC points and 384 separate calibration points completed.
  All three temperature bundles selected code 70 at 25 C / 3.3 V.
  Held-code DC accuracy and self-sustaining checks passed at all 21 V/T points.
- Of 21 startup/restart simulations, 17 completed and passed both readiness
  checks. Four aborted during power-down with ngspice timestep-too-small
  errors: -40 C at 3.0, 3.3 and 3.6 V; 25 C at 3.0 V. These are unresolved,
  not passes. The runner preserves completed measurements alongside failures.
- The independent `trim_nominal` and `smoke` entry points also completed.
- Additional 125 C DC checks at FF/FF/FF/FF and SS/SS/SS/SS completed;
  their room-temperature calibration codes were 71 and 73, respectively.
- Full, nominal, and smoke plots rendered successfully. The full validation
  CSV exported all 2,688 DC points even with the display limited to one
  waveform bundle, and included all 34 resolved cold/restart event records.

No schematic, device size, connection, physical resistor, PDK model, or
convergence tolerance was changed by this fix. It does not resolve the
observed power-down convergence failures or establish complete PVT signoff.
Physical trim Monte Carlo, dense post-trim TC, trimmed PSRR/noise, additional
DVDD sequencing and extracted-layout behavior remain outside this TB10 scope.

Full terminal traces are losslessly compressed when `retain_waveforms` is
false. Readiness and device-screen metrics use every adaptive sample;
only the compact plotting trace is reduced to about 12,000 points.

# TB05 repaired-core synchronization — 2026-09-27

`Bandgap_Core_LoopProbe.sch` is rebuilt from the current **untrimmed**
`Bandgap_Core.sch`, as requested. It includes the repaired startup network,
5 V device models, dimensions, multiplicities and connections. The only
electrical changes from that core are the intended M3/N2 gate cuts and four
probe ports. The seven-pin symbol, TB05 wiring, injection orientation, C1
connection, runner configuration and accuracy gate are preserved.

`verify_xschem_symbols.py` now independently compares actual Xschem-generated
core/probe netlists after closing the cuts. It checks every device statement,
pin order, f-port isolation and C1 on MAIN e. The comparison was also shown
to reject the previous stale probe, a shorted MAIN cut and a C1 moved to f.

Validation on the installed GF180MCUD models and ngspice 46:

- All 26 existing software checks pass.
- All 40 existing Xschem netlisting/portable-symbol checks pass.
- All 86 circuit statements match after closing the two probe cuts.
- Ten paired DC checks compare VREF, IDD and nine internal node voltages.
  Maximum VREF difference: 0.151421 microvolt. Maximum IDD difference:
  0.011813 nA. Maximum internal-node difference: 1.288430 microvolt.
- Six pairs cover all-typical corners at -40/25/125 C and 3.3/5 V.
  Four more use MOS/BJT/resistor/MIM = ff/ff/ff/ff at 125 C/5 V,
  ss/typical/ss/ss at -40 C/3.3 V, ff/ss/ss/ff at 125 C/5 V,
  and ss/ss/ff/ff at 125 C/3.3 V.
- Nine accuracy-valid points complete both conditional loop measurements.
  The last point fails the original accuracy gate as expected; no margin is
  accepted for it. This is a targeted update check, not the full PVT grid.

| Typical 25 C | VREF | IDD | MAIN conditional phase margin |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3.3 V | 1.193744919 V | 24.203180 uA | 88.5703 degrees |
| 5 V | 1.193896182 V | 31.520704 uA | 88.3117 degrees |

The paired DC comparisons use reltol=1e-6, abstol=1e-14 and vntol=1e-9,
with agreement limits of 10 microvolts and 0.1 nA. Actual loop runs retain
the project's original analysis settings. Simulations used `ngspice -n`
through a temporary wrapper to avoid unrelated container startup-file model
autoloads. No user startup file, PDK model, production core or runner was
modified. All simulations ran in temporary directories; existing results
were preserved.

BIAS has no unity crossing in these nine measurements; this does not supply
a conventional phase margin or certify the entire coupled network. The full
TB05 corner sweep still needs regeneration and execution on the updated
schematic. Historical TB05 results refer to the previous probe.

# Portable core-symbol validation — 2026-09-27

All ten testbenches now locate their intended core symbol beside the open
schematic through Xschem's Tcl path evaluation. `--configure` preserves this
reference and repairs older absolute references. It also escapes launcher quotes
through both Xschem parsing layers so folder names containing spaces remain intact.

- All 26 software checks passed.
- Xschem 3.4.8RC with the installed GF180 libraries generated 40 netlists: ten
  absolute-reference baselines, ten fresh-checkout exports, ten after relocation
  to a folder containing spaces, and ten after configuring and moving again.
- Every export ran from an unrelated working directory containing invalid
  same-named core symbols. All intended cores resolved, and all circuit netlists
  matched their baseline after excluding source-path comments and launchers.
- Configured launchers retained complete control blocks and correctly quoted
  runner/netlist arguments. Their absolute execution paths still require
  `--configure` after moving; core-symbol display does not.

No core schematic or symbol was edited, and no electrical simulations were run
for this change. Reproduce the Xschem checks with `python3 verify_xschem_symbols.py`
in the configured GF180 environment. Earlier electrical validation follows.

# TB10 unified workflow validation — 2026-09-18

TB10 is integrated into `run_bandgap.py`, `plot_bandgap.py`,
`bandgap_config.json`, `verify_suite.py` and the main README. The separate
`trim_testbench/` source package is no longer needed. Its inherited MIM block
is embedded verbatim in TB10's MODELS section; its license is retained at root.

## Checks

- 25 standard-library software checks pass, including the original 12 suite checks.
- All ten schematic launchers configure correctly and configuration is repeatable.
- Fresh Xschem export contains the same 124 DUT instances/parameters as the
  previously validated resistor-trim core.
- All 256 TT/25 C DC points complete and meet the assistance-off/bias-alive screen.
- The integrated DC VREF sweep agrees with the prior standalone runner within
  0.168 microvolt across all points.
- The selected code remains 70 (`1000110`, b6..b0), calibrated at 3.3 V and held at 5 V.
- Four figures, the combined PDF, common metrics CSV, full trim-code CSV and
  startup-event CSV are generated by the main plotter; waveform figures were
  visually inspected.
- The existing TB07 smoke simulation and plotting workflow also complete.
- Resume, DC-only mode, and the configured Xschem/ngspice launcher were exercised;
  the final launcher exits cleanly after the Python run.
- Replotting a DC-only run archives previous TB10 startup figures/CSVs; no stale
  startup plot remains among the current output files.

| AVDD | VREF at held code 70 | Cold settling after ramp | Restart settling after ramp |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 3.3 V | 1.194453675 V | 213.412 us, PASS | 141.018 us, PASS |
| 5 V | 1.194605059 V | 121.531 us, PASS | 80.690 us, PASS |

All three startup aids must fall below 1 nA and the monitored bias branches
remain above 10 nA. Readiness additionally requires the 1.194 V +/-0.5% band,
a 300 us deadline, at least 100 us final observation and sustained recovery.
Maximum transient timestep is 100 ns. DVDD rises first and stays at 3.3 V.

Both DC sweeps retain the approximately 0.209 mV upward step at code 63→64;
calibration searches all codes. The largest sorted voltage gap is about
1.7455 mV. Maximum measured trim gate-to-terminal magnitude is about 3.300118 V,
below the inherited 3.63 V diagnostic screen in these two nominal transients.
That screen is not a foundry reliability specification.

## Reproduce

After `--configure` and fresh Xschem netlisting:

```bash
python3 verify_suite.py
python3 run_bandgap.py --test TB10_RESISTOR_TRIM --deck /path/to/TB10_RESISTOR_TRIM.spice
python3 plot_bandgap.py --test TB10_RESISTOR_TRIM --profile trim_nominal
```

Use the standard `results/trim_nominal/` report/case/plots hierarchy. Decks,
logs and full terminal traces are retained in the case's timestamped attempt
directory; compressed plotting traces use the usual fingerprint-checked cache.
The local test artifacts and earlier standalone results have been preserved,
not committed to Git.

## Inputs and limits

Simulator: ngspice 46. Xschem: 3.4.8RC.
Installed GF180MCUD revision: `f6eeac7dad085ffcc829ccfd721f7b4ce39edcf7`.
No installed PDK file, core schematic or device dimension was changed.

SHA-256 of unchanged inputs:

- `Bandgap_Core.sch`: `8495e03e2719bad0c11659aa68c36efbe879ec8743c3b4d5c628f17122432f0a`
- `Bandgap_Core_Res.sch`: `d4be651bbb0c1c3641f7c1f7ac1f8d2a58e14ab587db74a17d58ef2e3bb38d38`
- inherited embedded MIM block: `25e3c4827734c378240b14cad600ed6f329b2e4d5bf418e18e6aa46cbf59b15a`

TB10 explicitly supports the nominal trim profile, not a full trim/PVT/Monte Carlo,
post-trim TC, PSRR/noise, extracted-layout or reliability campaign. AVDD-first,
DVDD loss and shutdown with retained analog charge remain unqualified. TB01–TB09
were not silently switched to the trimmed core.

The following notes describe the older release and its then-current inputs;
their historical hashes and qualification statements do not supersede the
current check above.

# Historical release validation — 2026-09-06

These checks validate the assembled workflow. They do not establish full-PVT circuit compliance, production yield, foundry reliability, or post-layout signoff.

## Uploaded work preserved

The following delivered files are byte-identical to the latest uploaded versions, after removing the upload suffix `(1)` from filenames:

| File | SHA-256 |
|---|---|
| Bandgap_Core.sch | 58f6f9b341b831a4b92e24ad496f512d9509ae768cd42937b235b96d72a117d1 |
| Bandgap_Core.sym | 0e1fa99cd49055dc72c617cf8603be1b4795edabdbc4ae00c70c1d05236c4662 |
| Bandgap_Core_LoopProbe.sch | b95d435565e23b058a55d17d81d102e583d4ecbdc26f903db0796afe5d4e4f8b |

The uploaded `validation.json` described structural/software verification of the connected loop probe, with electrical execution still pending in that upload. This release preserves the seven-pin symbol, e/f orientation, M3/N2 gate cuts, C1 connection, disconnected-probe rejection, and OP acceptance gate. That earlier metadata was not treated as a new simulation result or copied into runtime configuration.

## Software checks

`python3 verify_suite.py` passes 12 checks covering:

- exactly one shipped JSON and all nine control entries;
- full-profile case counts and unique case identifiers;
- preserved TB05 smoke default;
- consistent Monte Carlo seeds across V/T;
- exact white-noise and 1/f PSD integration on analytical fixtures;
- readiness requiring the reference to remain inside its target band;
- ordered supply-event points and complete recovery observation windows;
- missing completion/nonfinite waveform rejection;
- disconnected loop-probe rejection;
- MOS terminal mapping using the actual top-level instance name;
- recursive model-dependency discovery;
- rejection of invalid configuration settings.

Python syntax compilation passes for runner, plotter, and checks. All nine schematic path launchers were exercised with `--configure`. The generated schematics and symbols were checked for balanced Tcl syntax. The ZIP excludes caches and contains only one JSON file.

## Representative local simulator execution

Local ngspice runs used private SPICE equivalents parsed from the supplied schematic geometry, with hierarchy and the user's loop-probe orientation preserved. This was **not a full Xschem GUI/netlisting run**. The local public GF180 models were adapted to the uploaded installed-PDK names and this workspace's ngspice compatibility requirements. The adaptations include MOS multiplicity handling and a poly-resistor geometry-argument workaround. Consequently, especially for noise, these runs are workflow checks rather than validation of absolute numbers on the user's installed PDK.

| Check | Executions completed and parsed |
|---|---:|
| TB01–TB05 at nominal 5 V / 25 °C (TC still sweeps temperature) | 5 |
| TB06 three combined-mode seeds | 3 |
| TB07 nominal output noise | 1 |
| TB08 nominal OP/startup, including 63 MOS devices | 1 |
| TB09 smoke ramp, two brownouts, three-cycle sequence, and supply step | 5 |
| TB07 FF/SS × −40/125 °C × 3.0/5.5 V, other corner families typical | 8 |
| TB08 same eight stress combinations | 8 |
| Repeat the three TB06 seeds in separate simulator processes | 3 |

The three repeated seeds produced exactly matching parsed metrics; different seeds produced different reference voltages. These are only three draws and do not support a yield estimate. The smoke and stress cases completed execution, but completion is not a performance pass. Model/simulator warnings were present and were retained in case metadata; they were not suppressed into a clean-PDK certification.

The final nominal dataset produced **43 PNG figures, nine metrics CSVs, one TB08 device CSV, and one combined PDF** through the delivered plotting workflow. Representative Monte Carlo, device-voltage, and repeated-cycle plots were visually inspected; the Monte Carlo seed-axis formatting was corrected. Additional noise/device plots were generated from the eight stress combinations.

## Still required on the actual project environment

Run the smoke profiles through actual Xschem netlisting first, then run the selected full profiles against the exact installed PDK. Full matrices were generated and counted, not all electrically executed here. Confirm noise model suitability and review warnings. Then evaluate performance targets, convergence/timestep sensitivity near failures, statistical sample count and supported mismatch models, device reliability/ERC, and extracted-layout behavior. No area allocation or physical trim implementation was changed or certified by this testbench package.
